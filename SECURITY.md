# Security Improvements

This document outlines security improvements implemented in the Quiz application.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Secure JWT Storage

- **Before**: JWT tokens were stored in localStorage, making them vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **After**: JWT tokens are now stored in HttpOnly cookies which cannot be accessed by JavaScript, significantly reducing XSS vulnerability.
- **Changes**:
  - Added cookie-parser middleware
  - Updated auth.js to check for tokens in cookies
  - Modified login route to set HttpOnly cookies
  - Added logout route to clear cookies
  - Configured CORS to support credentials

### 2. Environment Variables for Secrets

- **Before**: JWT secret was hardcoded in config.js.
- **After**: JWT secret is loaded from environment variables with a fallback for development.
- **Changes**:
  - Added .env file support
  - Updated config.js to use process.env.JWT_SECRET
  - Added .env to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits

### 3. SQL Injection Protection Review

- **Verified**: The application was already using parameterized queries for database operations, which is the correct approach for preventing SQL injection.
- **Example**: `db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [username])` instead of string concatenation.

## Next Steps

For the next phase of security improvements, consider:

1. **Implement CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add consistent error handling across all routes
3. **Add Transaction Support**: Use transactions for critical database operations
4. **Implement Input Validation**: Add validation middleware for user inputs
5. **Set Up Proper Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation to prevent disk space issues

## Usage Notes For Developers

When testing the application:

1. The client now receives JWT token both as a cookie and in the response body (for backward compatibility)
2. Frontend code should be updated to use the cookie-based authentication approach
3. For API testing tools, you can either:
   - Enable cookies in your testing tool
   - Continue using the Authorization header which is still supported
